# FizzPop - Empowering everyone to paint with magic ink!

FizzPop is a whimsical visual editor that lets anyone bring ideas to
life through doodles and interactivity -- no coding required!

Built on Sodium functional reactive programming (FRP), FizzPop
gives you an intuitive canvas for connecting thoughts like ink
trails. Sketch logic, play with behavior, and build things you never
thought possible—all with the joyful ease of drawing.

Whether you're a curious kid, an artist, a teacher, or just someone
with a squiggly idea, FizzPop is your space to explore, tinker, and
smile.

### ✨ Features

- Draw reactive programs as easily as doodling
- Visual programming powered by Sodium FRP

- Designed for beginners and creative thinkers

> *“Our pioneers are those who transcend interaction — designers whose
> creations anticipate, not obey. The hero of tomorrow is not the next
> Steve Wozniak, but the next William Playfair. An artist who
> redefines how people learn. An artist who paints with magic ink.”*
> -- Brett Victor, [*Magic Ink*][MagicInk]

## Why is it called FizzPop?

I wanted to turn the idea of the [FizzBuzz coding test][FizzBuzz] on it's
head. Anyone can program with FizzPop!
